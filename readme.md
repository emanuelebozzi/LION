### LOKI

LOKI is a code that performs earthquake detection and location
using waveform coherence analysis (waveform stacking).

INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS
To use loki you will need:
- GCC6 or later versions or any C compiler that supports OpenMP calls

- Python3 libraries, Numpy and Obspy

- Python3 library: LatLonUTM converter, provided here but developed by third parts (soon this dependence will be removed by adding an internal function)
